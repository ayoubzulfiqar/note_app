# Top Note App

This is top note app created with **Flutter** and the UI design for this project was provided by the [Capi.design](http/capi.design).

This is still a beginner project which contain

1. **Onboarding Screens**
2. **Authentication** (Login and SignUp  screens)
3. **Password Verification**
4. **Writing Note** (Using Hive Database)
5. **Plans** (Premium and Basic Plans Screens)

![BLoC State Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/docs/assets/bloc_logo_full.png)

In this app the authentication process is design based on the Flutter BLoC State management which verify all the process and **Login** and **SignUp** process for us.. no external **API** are used.

![Hive Database](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/195895847/d0e10680-a3bf-11e9-9aab-778ec9660d33)
For making the writing process interactive and stabilize the data and storage I used **HIVE DataBase** which is purely on dart and it is noSQL Database basically perfect for small app.

## Reminder

Some of part of the screens are still hardcoded such as the Password Verification screens.

All the screens in this project are fully responsive and interactive on all the screen sizes.
